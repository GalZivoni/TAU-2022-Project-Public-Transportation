# TAU-2022-Project-Public-Transportation
4th Year Industrial Engineering Final Project In Colaboration With Minsitry Of Transportation

As a part of our final project, understanding the influence of the COVID-19 on public transportation in Israel, we have analyzed public transportation data from multiple data sources, focusing on bus drives. We have also created multiple regressions on different granularity levels (national,cluster and profile level data).

This repository includes the analyses files, as well as the raw data files used for the different analyses and the report (in hebrew) which contains additional information, explanations, conclusions and discussion.
